How to Stay Up-to-Date in Git

Overview

In this project, we will learn how to stay up-to-date with our Git repositories by updating and committing changes made by other collaborators. We will also update our own files and commit them to the repository.

Instructions

Update the README.md file in the main branch on GitHub.com.
Get all changes of the main branch locally by running git pull origin main.
Create a new file called up_to_date at the root of your directory.
In the up_to_date file, write the git command line used to get all changes from the main branch.
Add up_to_date to git by running git add up_to_date.
Commit the changes with the message "How to be up to date in git" by running git commit -m "How to be up to date in git".
Push the changes to the origin by running git push origin main.
